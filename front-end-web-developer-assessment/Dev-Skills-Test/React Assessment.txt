Attached is a small React project that has been intentionally simplified and partially incomplete. Your task is to complete a series of exercises that demonstrate your ability to work with existing code, debug issues, and add new features.
Instructions:
Download and unzip the provided project file.
Open a terminal in the project root and run:
npm install
npm run dev
 
The project will load at http://localhost:5173
 Review the README.md file included in the project for detailed task descriptions and setup instructions.
 Complete as many of the five tasks as you can. Tasks 1–4 are the core exercises; Task 5 is an optional bonus challenge.
 When finished, zip your completed project folder (excluding node_modules) and name it:
firstname_lastname_frontend_test.zip
Submit the zip file.
Please note that there’s no strict time limit, but we recommend spending about 2–3 hours total.

The web assessment should take a few hours so please let me know if this is a concern.

 

Here is the information we send along with the file. When they are done, can you please load all the files in a folder on a google drive

 

Part 1) Mock Coding Assessment

·                 Attached is a Photoshop file and .PNG versions (as well as a folder of assets) of a new site’s homepage mock. Fully code it out in HTML and CSS. Links are okay to have only a place holder anchor of #.

·                 For the drop down Product Category menus, we usually use either a simple CSS menu, or a 2 level menu with “fly out” second navigation. For this, we use the SuperFish JS plugin (https://superfish.joelbirch.design/). Use either method you prefer.

·                 I provided the fonts, but they are also google web fonts at https://fonts.google.com/. Feel free to use them directly from google.

·                 Do not worry about the page being responsive coding.

 

 

Part 2) JS Assessment

·                 These instructions are also in the HTML file.

·                 There is a form with 4 questions.

·                 Please use jQuery to validate that the first 2 questions have been filled in.

·                 In addition, use jQuery to “replace” the third question with a pre-defined drop down of options.


Bonus: Feel free to take this opportunity to “show off” if you would like.
